## 1. Overview

A point-to-point digital wireless communication system implemented with [GNU Radio](https://www.gnuradio.org/) to transmit and receive

- Image
- Bit Stream
- Real-time audio
in a point-to-point network using devices,Blade-RF.

___

## 2. Our Approach

1. Image Transmission
    - [x] Simulation
    - [x] Physically

- _Modulation Scheme_ : **2-FSK**
- _Evaluation Metric_ : Mean Squared Error (_MSE_) between the transmitted Image(_T_) and Received Image(_R_)
- MSE for Monochrome image of size _MxN_ is defined as

    _MSE_ $= \frac{1}{M \cdot N} \sum_{i=1}^{M} \sum_{j=1}^{N} [T(i,j) - R(i,j)]^{2}$

2. Binary Data Stream Transmission
    - [x] Simulation
    - [x] Physically

- _Modulation Scheme_ : **2-GFSK**
- _Evaluation Metric_ : Bit Error Rate (_BER_)

3. Voice Transmission (Real Time voice captured from MIC / Recorded voice clip)
    - [x] Simulation
    - [x] Physically

- _Modulation Scheme_ : **2-GFSK**
- _Evaluation Metric_ : Based on the Quality of the Received Voice (Evaluated by Hearing it)

## 3. Project Setup

```
NOTE : You have the option to directly refer to the GRC files that contain the relevant flowgraphs. It is not mandatory to set up the Interface.
```

### 3.1 GNU Radio

[GNU Radio](https://www.gnuradio.org/) is an open-source toolkit for software-defined radio development. It provides signal processing blocks to build versatile radio systems, including sophisticated in wireless communication systems.

Refer to their documentation on [how to set up GNU Radio](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/InstallingGR) on your device along with bladeRF driver installation.

Prefered : **Linux Environment**
```
We attempted driver installation in a Windows environment, but configuring the drivers proved challenging. It's recommended to opt for a Linux OS for a smoother GNU Radio installation.
```

### 3.2 GUI Setup

We used [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to interface our project with GRC flow graphs and python files generated by them.

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SasikaA073/CDP-communication-system
    cd CDP-communication-system
    cd ST_Webapp
    ```

2. Install venv

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python3-venv
    ```

3. Create a Python virtual environment named "gnu":

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv gnu
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    source gnu/bin/activate
    ```

5. Install the required Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file:

    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. Run the following to start the interface

    ```bash
    streamlit run Home.py
    ```
